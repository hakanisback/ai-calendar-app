## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn/pnpm
- OpenAI API key (get one from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys))

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-calendar.git
cd ai-calendar
```

2. **Run the setup script**

```bash
# Make the script executable if needed
chmod +x scripts/setup.sh

# Run the setup script
./scripts/setup.sh
```

3. **Update your environment variables**

After running the setup script, update the `.env` file with your OpenAI API key:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

4. **Start the development server**

```bash
npm run dev
```

5. **Open your browser**

### Manual Setup (Alternative)

If you prefer to set up the project manually, follow these steps:

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Set up environment variables (copy from `.env.example` to `.env` and update values)

3. Set up the database:

```bash
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
```

4. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Usage

1. **View Events**: The calendar displays all your events. Switch between month, week, and day views.
2. **Create Events**: Use natural language in the chat interface to create events. For example:
   - "Add a meeting with John tomorrow at 2pm"
   - "Schedule a dentist appointment next Monday at 10am for 1 hour"
   - "Lunch with Sarah on Friday at 12:30pm"
3. **Edit Events**: Click and drag events to reschedule them, or drag the edges to adjust their duration.
4. **Confirm Events**: The AI will ask for confirmation before creating events. Review the details and confirm or cancel.
